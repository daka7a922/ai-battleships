= Our targets =

Our target is to create an AI for the Game Battleships. So we want to achieve a working prototype, that is able to sink all hidden ships of the opponent with a minimal set of tryings. For evaluation we will also provide a few other less sophisticated agents (but still more intelligent than the random agent), so that we can show that our agent based on the structured AI approach performes (hopefully) better.

= Summary =

 * Create a prototypical environment for visualizing our agent
 * Well defined list of rules for our games
 *A function that randomly places the ships on the playground, according to these rules
 * 2 or 3 battleships agents whose actions are based on quite simple heuristics (without a structured AI approach)
 * 1 logical agent that tries to minimize the number of shots for sinking all ships on the playground. Therefore, we will consider a structured approach based on logic and on decision making under uncertainty
 * Statistical evaluation that shows the performance of the logical agent compared to the other agents
 * Final document, where we describe our approach and our methods in detail
